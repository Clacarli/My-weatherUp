# My-weatherUp

On a mission to digitalise my career, I dove into a coding journey from scratch and learned the ABC. 

This is a very simple yet simbolic result of my programming adventure, I have a huge gratitude toward this experience as it gave me also the empathy and understanding necessary to communicate to tech departments and other stakeholders involved in IT projects.

Communication and listening skills are the most challenging to cultivate but try wearing someone else's shoes, even if for just a day, and you will not be the same person again.
