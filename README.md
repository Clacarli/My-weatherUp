# My-weatherUp

On a mission to digitalise my career, I dove into a coding journey from scratch and learned the ABC. 
This is a very simple yet simbolic result of my programming adventure, I have a huge gratitude toward this experience as it gave me also the empathy and understanding necessary to communicate to tech departments and third parties.
Communication and listening skills are very difficult to cultivate but wearing someone else's shoes, even if for just a day, is the best way to do so.
